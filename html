        <h6>September 23, 2024</h6>
        
        <h4>After endless hours spent listening to podcasts, reading various blogs, and watching youtube videos, I still couldn't decide which was the best platform to kickstart start my programming journey.</h4> 
        
        <p>An advisor at one of my prospective coding boot camps recommended Harvard's <em>"CS50X"</em> course (which is free btw and 100% online). I signed up for the course a day later and started my first lecture. This course is structured like your typical college class, roughly 2+ hours worth of lectures followed with 3-4 projects to complete for certification (if purchased). </p>
        <p> Intially I was excited, I've always loved the experince of diving into something that is foreign to me. My first project used scratch, an application designed by MIT, targeting children as a way to learning the fundamentals of coding without actually using code.</p>
        <p>I'm going to be honest, the first few hours in I had so many fun ideas for what I could create, but I was struggling <strong>HARD</strong> to make these ideas come to life. It kind of left me feeling defeated, I thought to myself "If I can't use an application that's designed for chuildren to use, does this indicate I won't be good at coding?"</p>
        <p> I reminded myself that we all start somewhere and that I live in a world with endless inforamtion that can help, so I utilized the web and was able to finally bring my project to fruition after about 12+ hours. <strong>Great success!</strong> </p>
        
        <h2 class="blog-heads" id="Do-I-Know">"Do I even know what I just coded?"</h2>
        <h6>October 18, 2024</h6>
        
        <h4>"Do I even know what I just coded?" this started to become a frequent thought of mine after completing a CS50X project. I felt like I had gotten myself so caught up on deadlines (self-created ones) that I was rushing through projects and not really taking my time to fully understand what it was I was doing.</h4>
        <p>4 weeks in, I began to re-evaluate my thought processes, learning techniques, and the tools I was using. I was putting too much pressure on myself to complete tasks without even fully understanding them, which kind of seems like a waste of time in retrospect.</p>
        <p> I came to the conclusion that Harvard's CS50X course was really helpful, but it moves pretty fast, in terms of the amount of information it pushes out each week, just like any other traditonal college class. When in college, it's understandable, but when you're self-teaching, I personally think it's better to go at a pace that allows you to fully learn and digest information before moving forward. In my opinion, this course is better for fast-learners or people with prior coding experience.</p>
        
        <h2 class="blog-heads" id="Learning">Learning how to learn</h2>
        <h6>October 22, 2024</h6>
        <h4>Learning how to learn? Seems redundant. I remember watching a youtube video where a guy spoke about his self-taught coding journey, where he mentioned hitting the same block, feeling like he was completing projects but wasn't truly <em>learning</em> or atleast not as efficiently.</h4>
        <p>I went back and rewatched his video where he linked the course he used to teach him how to learn... more effectively that is. I changed my course of action and landed myself in this FREE course (I'll link this course at the bottom). <em>Forewarning: this course does take longer than I anticiapted, it likely won't be completed in one day, I think it took me a week to get through all the material.</em></p>
        <p>This course more so reminded me of techniques I had heard of previously but forgotten and wasn't utlizing. However, there was also new information given that I found useful. Upon completion of this course, I went back to all the tik toks I had saved where programmers discussed their favorite tools used for learning and this is how I made it here to...</p>

        <h6>November 28, 2024</h6>
        <h4>FTW stands for "For The Win" by the way if you were unsure.</h4>
        <p>A highly recommended free learning platform to use for coding was, you guessed it, Khan Academy.This course initally boosted my goddess-complex so high that I felt <strong>unstoppable</strong>, which was kind of nice for my motivation. This was because I came into a beginner's course now with <em>some</em> knowledge.</p>
        <p>I had been coding using C language which is older and much more finicky than JS. Moving into learning JS language felt like a swift breeze. The consistent small-projects, more so, knowledge checks that Khan Academy does in-between lessons are really nice. I'm quite ADHD, so I need information to be given in small digestable bits which is exactly what this course does! Yay!</p>
    
    <h2 class="blog-heads" id="shia-labeouf">Don't let your dreams just be dreams</h2>
    <h6>December 7, 2024</h6>
    <h4>Like Shia LaBeouf once said <em>"Don't let your dreams be dreams...JUST DO IT"</em></h4>
    
    <p>Within the next 3 months I will be elevating my learning by attending a full stack software development course, which I'm pretty excited about! I will be focused on front end and back end web development using Java, JS, SQL, HTML, CSS, and a few other langauges I beleive.</p>
    <p>Upon completeion of the course I hope to find myself earning six figures within the first year. I also want to continue learning new languages such as python, since it is not inlcuded in the course</p>
    <p>As of right now I am really enjoying using HTML and CSS, but I think I prefer programming languages as they are bit more challenging and complex. I can't wait for the day that I get to come back and look at this project to remind myself of where it all started. Wish me the courage to preservere and making my coding dreams come true!</p>
